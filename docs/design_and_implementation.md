## Design and implementation

The design of this application is minimalistic to get started with code examples on PSOC&trade; Edge MCU devices. All PSOC&trade; Edge E84 MCU applications have a dual-CPU three-project structure to develop code for the CM33 and CM55 cores. The CM33 core has two separate projects for the secure processing environment (SPE) and non-secure processing environment (NSPE). A project folder consists of various subfolders, each denoting a specific aspect of the project. The three project folders are as follows:

**Table 1. Application projects**

Project | Description
--------|------------------------
*proj_cm33_s* | Project for CM33 secure processing environment (SPE)
*proj_cm33_ns* | Project for CM33 non-secure processing environment (NSPE)
*proj_cm55* | CM55 project

<br>

In this code example, at device reset, the secure boot process starts from the ROM boot with the secure enclave (SE) as the root of trust (RoT). From the secure enclave, the boot flow is passed on to the system CPU subsystem where the secure CM33 application starts. After all necessary secure configurations, the flow is passed on to the non-secure CM33 application. Resource initialization for this example is performed by this CM33 non-secure project. It configures the system clocks, pins, clock to peripheral connections, and other platform resources. It then enables the CM55 core using the `Cy_SysEnableCM55()` function and the CM55 core is subsequently put to DeepSleep mode.

This example uses the CM33 non-secure applicatin of PSOC&trade; Edge MCU to execute a RTOS task (UDP Server task). The UDP server waits for the UDP client to establish the connection, after the connection establishes the server allows you to send the LED ON/OFF command to the UDP client. The client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.
